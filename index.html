        <h2> Cultivation </h2>
        <h4> This tag is to be used preferably only for Chinese novels. Cultivation refers to the protagonist trying to acquire immortality and/or supreme power by the accumulation and usage of Qi. This tag is typical of the Xianxia genre. The Mundane World is based on the light novel called, "Martial God Asura". The setting takes place at "Azure Dragon School", the starting sect of the main character, "Chu Feng". In cultivation novels, as you reach the pinnacle of the mortal world, you can either choose to stay in the mortal world and be the Overlord there, or choose to ascend up to the Divine world. If you choose to stay, their cultivation will halt forever, but if you ascend to the Divine Realm, you can achieve new heights that you can never dream of. Destroying stars with a single punch, touring the entire Universe at unbelievable speed, and ending the life of an entire mortal race will all be child's play. In this world, you will explore the Azure Dragon Sect, ascend to the Divine Realm just like those Legendary Cultivators, and touring the Cosmos to take in those beautiful views. </h4><hr>
